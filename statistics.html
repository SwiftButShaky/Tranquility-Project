            <h2>Understanding Mental Health</h2>
            <p>
                Mental health is an essential part of overall well-being, yet it remains an issue affecting millions worldwide.
                In the U.S. alone, more than 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness, and around 1 in 20 struggle with serious conditions.
                Youth mental health is also concerning, with 1 in 3 high school students reporting frequent emotional distress.

            <p>
                Despite these alarming statistics, nearly half of those in need don’t receive treatment.
                Poor mental health can lead to increased risks of suicide, workplace challenges, strained relationships,
                and reduced quality of life. By prioritizing awareness, access to care, and community support, we can combat stigma and
                ensure individuals receive the help they deserve—because mental health matters just as much as physical health.
